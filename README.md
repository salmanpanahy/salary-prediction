# salary-prediction
This repo includes a jupyter notebook that goes through different steps of a project for predicting salary based on some job features.
The notebook includes three steps, defining the problem, discovering the data, and developing solution. The whole process is explained step by step in the notebook using markdowns.
The problem to be solved is predicting salary for jobs based on features of it. 
The discovery section starts with loading and inspecting data, cleaning data, EDA, and establishing a baseline.
EDA or exploratory data analysis includes summarizing variables, looking for correlations between features and the target variable and among features, and inspecting  outliers.
Studying the correlation between features and target includes graphs, bar charts, and box plots to visualize correlations and distributions in a meaningful way. 
Develop part includes preparing data for modeling, selecting and tuning algorithms to predict salary in such a way that reduces the risk of over fitting and under fitting, and testing algorithms to find the best one.
And finally it is suggested that although Gradient Boosting Rgressor creates the best result, Random Forest Regressor also is a reasonable choice due to the speed of processing.
